<h2 class="intro">About the author and this site.</h2>

My name is John Aaron Reesman. When I can, I use _jreesman_ online.

I live in Milwaukie, Oregon (which is just a short stone's throw from Portland)

Prior to moving to the Pacific Northwest, I lived in San Antonio, TX. Now that I live here, I fully support the concept of Texas seceding from the United States, provided, of course, that we maintain control of our borders.
